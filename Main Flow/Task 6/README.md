# Task 6: Time Series Analysis - Sales Forecasting

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze historical sales data over time and forecast future sales using statistical models like **ARIMA**.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Date**: The timestamp of the recorded sales (Date).
- **Sales**: The number of units sold or revenue on that date (Numeric).

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels
- **Model**: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

## 📈 Process Overview
1. **Visualize Sales Trends**:
   - Plot historical sales data to identify patterns such as **seasonality**, **trends**, or **irregularities**.
   - Use **line charts** or **moving averages** to observe fluctuations over time.
   
2. **ARIMA Forecasting**:
   - Apply **ARIMA** model to the time series sales data.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model and generate forecasts for future periods.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measure the difference between the predicted and actual values.
   - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Measure the accuracy of the forecast as a percentage.
